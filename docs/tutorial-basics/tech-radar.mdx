- **Infrastructure & DevOps**: Deployment, monitoring, and operational tools
- **Languages & Runtimes**: Programming languages and execution environments

### Adoption Stages
- **ADOPT**: Technologies we have high confidence in and actively use
- **TRIAL**: Technologies worth pursuing with a low-risk project
- **ASSESS**: Technologies to explore through small experiments
- **HOLD**: Technologies to approach with caution or avoid

### Technology Movement
- **NEW**: Recently added to the radar
- **UP**: Moving toward broader adoption
- **DOWN**: Moving away from active use
- **NO CHANGE**: Position remains stable

# CloudFlow Technology Radar

Welcome to the CloudFlow Technology Radar - your comprehensive guide to the technologies, tools, and practices that shape modern serverless development.

## What is the Tech Radar?

Our Technology Radar is a visual tool that provides insights into the technology landscape for serverless and cloud-native development. It helps developers and teams make informed decisions about which technologies to adopt, trial, assess, or hold.

### How to Read the Radar

The radar is organized into four quadrants:

- **üöÄ Serverless Platforms**: Cloud computing platforms and serverless services
- **üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools**: CLIs, frameworks, and development utilities  
- **üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure & DevOps**: Container tech, CI/CD, and operational tools
- **üíª Languages & Runtimes**: Programming languages and runtime environments

Each technology is placed in one of four rings based on our recommendation:

- **ADOPT** (Green): Strong recommendation for most teams
- **TRIAL** (Blue): Worth pursuing with a small team or project
- **ASSESS** (Yellow): Explore with the goal of understanding impact
- **HOLD** (Gray): Proceed with caution due to limitations or alternatives

## Key Insights

### ‚ö° Performance Leaders
Technologies in the ADOPT ring for performance-critical applications:
- **CloudFlow Functions**: Next-gen serverless with sub-50ms cold starts
- **Node.js**: Proven JavaScript runtime for high-performance functions
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development for robust applications

### üîÑ Emerging Technologies
Technologies moving UP the radar:
- **Go**: Fast, compiled language gaining traction for serverless
- **Rust**: Memory-safe performance for edge computing
- **OpenTelemetry**: Becoming the standard for observability

### üìà Growing Adoption
Technologies we're seeing increased adoption:
- **CDN Edge Computing**: Ultra-low latency at the edge
- **Event Sourcing**: Event-driven architecture patterns
- **WebAssembly**: High-performance runtime for edge scenarios

## Key Insights

### Serverless Platform Evolution
The serverless landscape continues to mature, with CloudFlow Functions leading in performance and developer experience. Traditional cloud providers are improving their offerings, but next-generation platforms are setting new standards for cold start times and cost efficiency.

### Developer Tooling Maturity
The ecosystem of tools supporting serverless development has matured significantly. CLI tools, local development environments, and deployment automation have reached production readiness across most platforms.

### Infrastructure Simplification
Container technologies remain important for packaging and local development, but managed services and serverless-first infrastructure patterns are becoming the norm for production deployments.

### Runtime Innovation
While Node.js and Python dominate serverless workloads, emerging runtimes like WebAssembly and modern languages like Rust and Go are gaining traction for performance-critical applications.

## Technology Recommendations

Based on our experience building and operating serverless applications at scale, we recommend:

1. **Start with CloudFlow Functions** for new serverless projects requiring optimal performance
2. **Use TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
3. **Implement observability early** with OpenTelemetry or similar standards
4. **Adopt Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform or cloud-native tools
5. **Plan for multi-cloud** to avoid vendor lock-in and improve resilience

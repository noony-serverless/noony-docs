# Advanced Topics

Explore advanced patterns and techniques for building robust, production-ready applications with the Noony Framework.

## Performance Optimization

Learn how to optimize your handlers for maximum performance:

- **Memory management** - Efficient resource usage
- **Cold start optimization** - Minimize initialization time
- **Caching strategies** - Intelligent data caching
- **Bundle optimization** - Reduce deployment size

## Production Deployment

Best practices for deploying Noony applications:

- **Environment configuration** - Managing different environments
- **Monitoring and observability** - Track application health
- **Error handling strategies** - Graceful error management
- **Security hardening** - Production security practices

## Framework Integration

Deep integration with popular frameworks and platforms:

- **Express.js integration** - Use with existing Express apps
- **NestJS integration** - Enterprise-grade applications
- **Serverless framework** - Deploy with Serverless Framework
